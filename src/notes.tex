\section*{A Swift Tour}
Use \textbf{let} for declaring constants and \textbf{var} for variables. The value of constant
can be initlized only once and it does not need to be initlized prior to compilation. Hence, we can
do it during runtime! But it can only be initialized only once.

\begin{minted}{swift}
  let x = 42
  println("Hello, \(x)!")
\end{minted}


\textbf{Why are they doing it?}

\textbf{What are they doing?}
They are using CNN based deep learning architectures to perform CVC.

\textbf{How are they doing it?}
They improve upon previous CNN architectures specifically (GoogleNet and AlexNet)

\section*{The Basics}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Performance Evaluation
    \item Experiments on orientation guidance for finding optimal apical views 
    and a comparison between models trained with either 2-D or 3-D data
  \end{itemize}

\section*{Basic Operators}
