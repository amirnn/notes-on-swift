\section*{Abstract (Why? What?)}

\textbf{Why are they doing it?}

\textbf{What are they doing?}
They are using CNN based deep learning architectures to perform CVC.

\textbf{How are they doing it?}
They improve upon previous CNN architectures specifically (GoogleNet and AlexNet)

\section*{Their Goals:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Performance Evaluation
    \item Experiments on orientation guidance for finding optimal apical views 
    and a comparison between models trained with either 2-D or 3-D data
  \end{itemize}

\section*{What are their results?}
