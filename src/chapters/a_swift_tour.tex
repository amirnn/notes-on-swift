\section*{A Swift Tour}
Use \textbf{let} for declaring constants and \textbf{var} for variables. The value of constant
can be initlized only once and it does not need to be initlized prior to compilation. Hence, we can
do it during runtime! But it can only be initialized only once.

\begin{minted}{swift}
  let x = 42
  println("Hello, \(x)!")
\end{minted}
